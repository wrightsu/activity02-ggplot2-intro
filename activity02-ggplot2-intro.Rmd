In the R code chunk below, I am setting a global option for this `.Rmd` report.
For the time being you can, "pay no attention to the code between lines 10 and 12."

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(error = TRUE)
```

## Data and packages

Data were collected and made available by [Dr. Kristen Gorman](https://www.uaf.edu/cfos/people/faculty/detail/kristen-gorman.php) and the [Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER](https://pal.lternet.edu/) (a member of the [Long Term Ecological Research Network](https://lternet.edu/)).
Drs. [Allison Horst](https://allisonhorst.github.io/) and [Alison Hill](https://alison.rbind.io/) packaged these data into [`{palmerpenguins}`](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/).
The `penguins` data set contains the following variables:

![Meet the Palmer penguins](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/reference/figures/lter_penguins.png)

All artwork by [@allison_horst](https://twitter.com/allison_horst).

- `species`: a factor denoting penguin species (Adélie, Chinstrap and Gentoo)
- `island`: a factor denoting island in Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica (Biscoe, Dream or Torgersen)
- `bill_length_mm`: a number denoting bill length (millimeters)
- `bill_depth_mm`: a number denoting bill depth (millimeters)
- `flipper_length_mm`: an integer denoting flipper length (millimeters)
- `body_mass_g`: an integer denoting body mass (grams)
- `sex`: a factor denoting penguin sex (female, male)
- `year`: an integer denoting the study year (2007, 2008, or 2009)

We will need to install `{palmerpenguins}` in your RStudio session to be able to use this.
There are a couple of ways to do this, but my preferred method is to type the following in your **Console** pane (this should be the pane below this open `.Rmd` file).
Note that you should only ever type this in your Console (this should not be included in any R Markdown files).

```
install.packages("palmerpenguins")
```

After a brief amount of time, your Console should display:

```

```

You can verify that this package has been installed (and view the other packages that are already installed) using the RStudio IDE.
First, in the **Files** pane, click on the **Packages** tab.
Then, either scroll or search for `palmerpenguins`.
Note that this tab is another place where you can install packages.
In practice, you install a package once (or each time an update is made), then load it (using `library`) each time you start RStudio.

In the code chunk below, I load the package, and show a snippet of the `penguins` dataset.

```{r palmerpenguins}
library(palmerpenguins)
penguins
```

While I believe that most of the variables are relatively self-explanatory, we should still make sure we understand what information we have.
Type the following in your **Console** to view the help documentation for the `penguins` dataset: `?penguins`.
This should also only ever be typed in your Console (not included in an R Markdown file).

Update the list of variables that I provided above (i.e., lines 24-31) to provide descriptions of each of the variables.

The image below show how bill length and bill depth were measured.

![Bill length and bill depth measurements for penguins](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/reference/figures/culmen_depth.png)

Beyond `{palmerpenguins}` we will also need `{ggplot2}` for creating visualizations.

```{r ggplot2}
library(ggplot2)
```

## Analysis

### Explore Distributions

Below is a comparative boxplots for the distribution of `flipper_length_mm` for the three `species`.

```{r boxplots-no-color}
ggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = species)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

From your preparations, you saw that you can add color to plots by mapping a variable to one of the color aesthetics.
For this boxplot, we want to double-encode the variable `species` to not only the `y` axis, but also the `fill` aesthetic.
In the code chunk below, add the missing code (i.e., replacing the `___`) to have our comparative boxplots also include some coloring.

```{r boxplot-colors}
ggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = species, ___ = ___)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

Now, comment on what you notice from these boxplots.

**Response**: All three have one color. 


Another way to visualize distributions are with points.
You may have heard of dotplots before (one-dimensional scatterplots).
We can create something similar with jitterplots using `geom_jitter`.
In the code chunk below, complete it so that it produces a jitterplot.

```{r jitterplot}
ggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = species, ___ = ___)) +
  ___()
```

Comment on the strengths of the boxplot compared to the jitterplot and vice versa.
That is, what can you easily determine by looking at the boxplot?
What about the jitterplot?

**Response**:


Knit, then stage everything listed in your **Git** pane, commit (with a meaningful commit message), and push  to your GitHub repo.
Then, go to GitHub and compare/contrast your `activity02-ggplot2-intro.Rmd` and `activity02-ggplot2-intro.md` files.
Which is easier to read?
Which looks more professional?

**Response**:


Now, wouldn't it be nice if we could combine these two plots so that we get the benefits of both!?!
That is, how can we overlay the jitterplot over the boxplot?
Try doing the following in the code chunk below with my *hint*:

- Re-create the boxplot with color that you did above, then
- *Add* another geometry layer for the jitterplot.

```{r box-jitter-combined}

```

Play around with doing the jitterplot laid over the boxplot and the boxplot laid over the jitterplot.
Which do you prefer?
Why?

**Response**:


This is getting us closer to one of my favorite plots - the raincloud plot.
We are not quite ready to create this plot, but we will get there later this semester!

![raincloud plot](img/raincloud-plot.png)

Suppose that you wanted to only color the points in your combined plot, but not the individual boxplots - you want the boxplots to be the default white coloring.
In the code chunk below, explore different methods to try to create this plot.
A hint, all `geom_*` have a `mapping` argument.

```{r jitter-colored-only}

```

In the above code chunk, continue to play around with having the aesthetics mapped in the different layers.
For example, how does having all of them mapped in the `ggplot` call compared to having these instead mapped in the `geom_boxplot` layer?
Comment on what you notice.

**Response**:


Knit, then stage everything listed in your **Git** pane, commit (with a meaningful commit message), and push  to your GitHub repo.
Go to GitHub and verify that your `activity02-ggplot2-intro.Rmd` file appears as you intended it to.


<img src="README-img/noun_pause.png" alt="pause" width = "20"/> <b>Planned Pause Point</b>: If you have any questions, contact your instructor or another group.
At this point, you are welcome to do your own thing or continue in this document to try some more advanced tasks.

### Exploration

Below is a histogram with a smoothed density (think proportion) area curve behind it.
I had to do a "trick" in my histogram layer to put both of these plots on the same y-axis scale, but we will ignore that for the time being.
There appear to be two noticeable peaks in the distributions of bill lengths: one around 39 mm and one around 46 mm.

![histogram and density plot](img/histogram-density.png)

Create graphs to explore the relationship between `bill_length_mm` and each of `species`, `sex`, and `island` (you should have three total graphs).
Using these three graphs to discuss which of these three categorical variables seems to be contributing more to these two peaks and explain your reasoning.

```{r bill_length_by_species}

```


```{r bill_length_by_sex}

```


```{r bill_length_by_island}

```

**Response**:



Knit, then stage everything listed in your **Git** pane, commit (with a meaningful commit message), and push  to your GitHub repo.
Go to GitHub and verify that your `activity02-ggplot2-intro.Rmd` file appears as you intended it to.

### Scatterplots

You created some scatterplots in Preparation 3.
Here we continue exploring scatterplots using `{ggplot2}`.

In the code chunk below, create a scatterplot for the relationship between `flipper_length_mm` and `body_mass_g`.

```{r flipper_vs_mass}

```

Describe any patterns that you notice.

**Response**:


Recreate your scatterplot in the code chunk below; however,  *map* `species` to the `color` and `shape` aesthetics.

```{r flipper_vs_mass_with_species}

```

Describe any patterns that you notice.

**Response**:


The previous plot looked great except even in this rather small dataset (n = 344), there might are a number of points overlapping.
In the R code chunk below, *set* the values (instead of mapping a variable to an aesthetic) of `size` (using some value larger than zero) and `alpha` (using some value between 0 and 1) to make your previous plot more effective.

```{r flipper_vs_mass_with_size_alpha}

```

Discuss the decisions you made to help your plot be easier to read.

**Response**:



Knit, then stage everything listed in your **Git** pane, commit (with a meaningful commit message), and push  to your GitHub repo.
Go to GitHub and verify that your `activity02-ggplot2-intro.Rmd` file appears as you intended it to.

You can now go back to the `README` file.
